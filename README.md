Password Generation Challenge

I received some assistance from Kyle about the proper way to use window prompts and alerts, he also helped me with some syntax since I have significantly more practice in C# than javascript.

A lot of this code is just prior knowledge from some game development I have done in the past.

A lot of the code is referenced from the work we have been doing in class. None copied, all written from scratch but definitely used class materials as resources.

Used W3 Schools as a general aid especially on the proper structure for the input and buttons.

A couple things were from stack Overflow and I tried to comment where I used it (just one piece about accessing and getting lengths of keys within objects. Lines 101-102 in code as of writing this.)
